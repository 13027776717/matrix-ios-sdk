 Out of the box, the tests are supposed to be run with the iOS simulator attacking
 a test home server running on the same Mac machine.
 The reason is that the simulator can access to the home server running on the Mac 
 via localhost. So everyone can use a localhost HS url that works everywhere.
 
 You are free to change this URL and you have to if you want to run tests on a true
 device.
 
 Here, we use one of the home servers launched by the ./demo/start.sh script
